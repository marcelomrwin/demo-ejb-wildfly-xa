# Support files

This folder contains the configuration files to generate the images used in the demo

## Generate wildfly images

To generate images, the [Galleon](https://docs.wildfly.org/21/Galleon_Guide.html) project was used to define a base image and then this image was customized basically by editing the standalone.xml configuration file

Each Dockerfile file has a reference to a folder that must be in the same root as the Dockerfile. This folder is called _server_ and corresponds exactly to the same folder generated by the maven galleon plugin that generates a version of wildfly customized for the application
